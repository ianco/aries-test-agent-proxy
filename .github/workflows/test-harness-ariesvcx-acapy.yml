name: test-harness-ariesvcx-acapy
# RUNSET_NAME: "aries-vcx to acapy"
# Scope: AIP 1.0
# Exceptions: None
#
# Summary
#
# This runset uses the current main branch of Aries VCX for all of the agents except Bob (holder),
# which uses the master branch of ACA-Py.
# @RFC0023 is excluded, as aries-vcx does not handle unqualified DIDs in invitations/responses
#
# Current
#
# Most tests are currently struggling, due to aries-vcx reporting the wrong connection state to the
# backchannel. Being resolved here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx/issues/1253
# @RFC0793 has relatively low success due to aries-vcx not supporting full range of DID methods in
# these tests.
# *Status Note Updated: 2024.07.05*
